# BikeshareProj
 Ran PostgreSQL Queries on DC Bikeshare Data.
 Ran MS SQL Server queries (Date Manipulation), functions and stored procedures on similar data through a Data Camp course. I put this in a jupyter notebook in order to present it in an organized way with notes; however, I ran this code externally.
