# BikeshareProj
 Ran PostgreSQL Queries on DC Bikeshare Data using psycopg2 in Python.
 Ran MS SQL Server and MySQL queries that allowed me to practice declaring variables, manipulating dates, and creating/altering/deleting stored procedures on similar bikshare data and other data. I put this in a jupyter notebook named MSQLPRocfunc.ipynb in order to present it in an organized way with notes; however, I ran this code externally.
