# BikeshareProj  
Bikeshare project.ipynb: I used SQL to run PostgreSQL queries. I created and executed custom PostgreSQL functions and stored procedures against DC Bike Share data. Â 

MSQLPRocfunc.ipynb: I also followed along with a tutorial using similar bike share data using MS SQL Server. In this tutorial, I practiced declaring variables and manipulating dates. Finally, I practiced stored procedures in both MS SQL Server and MySQL.
